<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol type="a">
    <li>
        Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350Â°F &#40;175 &#176;C&#41;. Line baking sheets with parchment
        paper or lightly grease them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter,
granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture becomes light and fluffy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add Eggs and Vanilla: Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully
incorporated before adding the next. Add the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.
    </li>
    <li>Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and
        salt.</li>
    <li>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture,
        mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
    <li>Fold in Chocolate Chips: Gently fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed
        throughout the dough.
        </li>
    <li>Form Cookie Dough: Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded tablespoons of dough
        onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving space between each cookie for spreading.</li>
    <li>Bake: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for 10&#45;12 minutes or until
        the cookies are golden brown around the edges.</li>
    <li>Cool and Enjoy&#58; Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the
        baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool
        completely.</li>
    <li>Serve&#58; Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk or as
        a treat any time of the day&#33;</li>

<h2>Tips:</h2>
<li>For chewier cookies, slightly underbake them and let them rest on the baking sheet for a few extra minutes after removing them from the oven.</li>

<li>You can add chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans for extra texture if desired.</li>

<li>Store cookies in an airtight container to maintain freshness.</li>
